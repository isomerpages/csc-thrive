<h2>Leveraging On Data Analytics</h2>
<p>Over the years, HR technology has evolved and revolutionised the way we
work. With the advent of large language modelling, artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning, HR practitioners now have powerful tools that
can help to streamline work and make more informed choices at the workplace.
&nbsp;These technology advances are closely linked to HR analytics, which
continues to be a concrete approach for HR to better understand the workforce.
HR analytics remain the mainstay to identify patterns and trends in employee
behaviour, performance and engagement, and to answer crucial HR questions
such as, “How can we improve employee experience? Who will leave and when?
What skills and talent do we need 5 years down the road?”</p>
<p>Check out our curation below, where we explore how HR can leverage on
data analytics to drive people decisions!</p>
